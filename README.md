Welcome to the Jurassic Park cage management system! This service manages the inventory of all cages in the park, their power status, and it tracks the dinosaurs that are kept within each cage. Special care has been taken to ensure that only compatible species are kept within each cage. Power for each cage is also managed and protected by this system. This system ensures that we don't cut power to any cage that is housing any dinosaurs as per our learnings from recent events.
